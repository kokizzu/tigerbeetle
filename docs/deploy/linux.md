# Deploying on Linux

## systemd

TigerBeetle includes an example [systemd unit](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/tree/main/tools/systemd/) for use with Linux systems that use systemd.
The unit is configured to start a [single-node cluster](../quick-start/single-binary.md), so you may need to adjust it for other cluster configurations.
Instructions to do so are in our GitHub repository.
